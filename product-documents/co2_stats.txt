Percentage renewable: 
    - https://www.exeter.ac.uk/media/universityofexeter/campusservices/sustainability/pdf/2020-21_Electricity_Consumption.pdf
    - 7% of university's electricity is non-renewable
    - The rest is under third parties:
        - For this will use estimated CO2 per kwh given by the UK government:
            - https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/greenhouse-gas-reporting-conversion-factors-2022
            - This is 0.19338 kg/kwh (2022)



How were number of rooms approximated:
- Selected buildings we knew (Amory, XFI, Harrison)
- Each estimated number of rooms results:
    - Amory: 60, 100, 80, 80, 60 (average: 76)
    - XFI: 30, 20, 15, 30, 20 (average: 23)
    - Harrison: 60, 50, 50, 50, 50 (average: 52)
- Divided total kwh for building by estimated number of rooms for estimate kwh per room
    - Stats from 2018/19: https://www.exeter.ac.uk/about/sustainability/energyandwater/energyuse/
    - Amory total: 537805
    - XFI total: 121001
    - Harrison total: 615482
    - Amory kwh/r: 7076.38
    - XFI kwh/r: 5260.91
    - Harrison kwh/r: 11836.19
    - Average kwh/r: 8057.83
- did total kwh for all buildings divided by estimated average kwh per room
     - Total for rooms used in project: 11999806
        - From https://www.exeter.ac.uk/about/sustainability/energyandwater/energyuse/
- From this received 1489 rooms in the buildings we looked at
